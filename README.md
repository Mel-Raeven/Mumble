# Mumble

This is a project i did for school. It's an app made made with Vue and a Python backend. The backend is a micro service based architecture.

## Try it yourself!

Keep in mind that its a school project so not every feature you would expect is integrated. If you still want to run it you can use the docker compose file to run the app. Keep in mind that you need to provide an SQL database yourself.
